I found this this article interesting  ["I made my own git!"](https://tonystr.net/blog/git_immitation) 
 
## Summary

This article is written by [Tony Str](https://github.com/tonystr) and explores a version control system he developed called **tvc**, which is inspired by **Git**. In the article, he explains the motivation behind the project, walks through the core implementation details, and shares the complete source on this [repository](https://github.com/tonystr/t-version-control).

I found this piece particularly interesting because understanding the inner workings of the tools we use every day is always valuable. I hope it inspires you as well!
